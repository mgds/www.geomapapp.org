title: GeoMapApp At Sea
---
<p>
	For people wishing to use GeoMapApp whilst they are out at sea or 
	if they are working in areas with missing or unreliable internet, 
	we can provide a "<i>GMA@Sea</i>" disk. It is a portable hard drive that plugs 
	into any computer. It is a self-contained version of GeoMapApp that works 
	with no internet connection. It can, for example, be useful for helping 
	to see the results of near-real-time bathymetric surveying by importing 
	grids of newly-acquired swath data and comparing this to existing coverage; 
	for determining potential waypoints for station locations; and, for 
	identifying new areas in which to acquire underway geophysical data. 
</p>
<p>
	The <i>GMA@Sea</i> disk is free apart from the cost of sending a replacement disk 
	and the cost of shipping. If you would like one of these <i>GMA@Sea</i> disks for your cruise, 
	please <a href="mailto:info@marine-geo.org?subject=GMA@Sea disk">contact us</a> 
	for details at least one month before you need the disk. So that we can keep 
	track, please also tell us which ship you will be sailing on, the cruise ID, 
	the purpose of the cruise, and the intended use of the <i>GMA@Sea</i> disk.
