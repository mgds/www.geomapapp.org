		<h3><a name="InstallIssues" id="InstallIssues"></a>Problems Installing GeoMapApp</h3>

			<p> <b>GeoMapApp won't start. What should I do?</b> <br />
			GeoMapApp is a Java-based application and Java needs to be installed on your computer for 
			GeoMapApp to run. For Mac users, the default downloaded version of GeoMapApp comes bundled 
			with Java 8. So, downloading the default version should work right away. 
			For PC and Linux/UNIX users, 
			<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml">check the version of Java</a> 
			installed on your computer. It needs to be Java 8 or higher. If running the "java -version" 
			command (without the quotation marks) from a terminal window, look for a value of 1.8.something or higher. 
			The latest version of Java 8 is <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">here</a>. 
			Note that PC users with high-resolution monitors may need to install 
			<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java 9 or higher</a>  
			to get the correct font size in the menus.
			</p>


			<p> <b>Which version of Java do I need to run GeoMapApp?</b> <br />
			To run GeoMapApp, Java 8 or higher needs to be installed on your computer. For Mac users, 
			the downloaded version of GeoMapApp already comes bundled with Java 8. 
			For PC and Linux/UNIX 
			<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml">check the version of Java</a> 
			installed on your computer. It needs to be Java 8 or higher. If running the "java -version" 
			command (without the quotation marks) from a terminal window, look for a value of 1.8.something or higher. 
			The latest version of Java 8 is <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">here</a>. 
			Note that PC users with high-resolution monitors may need to install 
			<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java 9 or higher</a>  
			to get the correct font size in the menus.
			</p>

			<p> <b>The default Mac download of GeoMapApp is bundled with Java. Why?</b> <br />
			For Mac users, the Java-bundled download of GeoMapApp includes Java 8 which avoids  
			installation issues for some users. The bundled version requires about 160 MBytes 
			of disk space. An unbundled version is available   
			<a href="https://app.geomapapp.org/MapApp/GeoMapApp_NoJavaBundle.dmg">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Installation on Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitan) fails. How should I fix it?</b> <br />
			Some users reported problems starting GeoMapApp under Mac OS X El Capitan version 10.11. 
			The following two-pronged approach fixes the issue: First, ensure that the latest El Capitan 
			bug fixes have been installed. Next, delete your <i>.GMA</i> folder (see item below), 
			and restart GeoMapApp. It should now work.
			</p>

			<p> <b>I was told to delete my <i>.GMA</i> folder. How do I do that?</b> <br />
			On a <b>PC</b>: Use a Windows navigator window to navigate to your home directory. 
			Look for a folder called "<i>.GMA</i>" (dot GMA), and delete it. <br>
			On a <b>Mac</b>: The hidden folder called "<i>.GMA</i>" (dot GMA) is not shown in the Finder. 
			Instead, it must be found using a terminal window, as follows.<br>
			In the Finder, go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app. 
			A terminal window should appear. <br>
			To get a list of all files (the ".GMA" folder should be listed), type: <i>ls -a</i> <br>
			To remove the folder, type: <i>rm -r .GMA</i> <br>
			To be sure it is gone, type: <i>ls -a</i></li> <br>
			Re-start GeoMapApp.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Should I download and install GeoMapApp or run WebStart?</b> <br />
			Downloading and installing GeoMapApp on your local machine is preferred but sometimes 
			that might not be possible. For example, machines in a school computer lab may allow 
			only an administrator to install programs. So, we provide a browser-based 
			<strong><a href="http://app.geomapapp.org/gma_webstart/GeoMapApp.jnlp">WebStart</a></strong> 
			function to start GeoMapApp. The WebStart function requires that the browser is 
			Java-enabled but a recent Java security issue was accompanied with an official 
			recommendation to disable Java within browsers. If WebStart does not work, it is 
			likely that Java was disabled in your web browser, but you can still run GeoMapApp 
			by downloading the regular version of GeoMapApp to your computer.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Will GeoMapApp run on a Chromebook?</b> <br />
			Yes but you may need to to go through the following steps: 
			(1) Install <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/crouton-turn-your-chromebook-into-far-more-than-a-glorified-web-browser-663044/">Crouton</a> 
			which in turn will install the Ubuntu version of Linux.
			2) Install Java. 
			3) Install GeoMapApp. We tested that in a virtual Chrome OS environment and it worked fine.
			</p>

			<p> <b>The menus are tiny on my high-resolution display. Can that be fixed?</b> <br />
			On Windows machines with hi-res displays, you will need to install Java 9 or higher 
			to get the menus back to their normal size. Java 9 or higher is available 
			<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>.

		<p style="text-align: right;"><a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<h3><a name="Menus" id="Menus"></a>Menus</h3>
			
			<p> <b>How often are new data sets added to GeoMapApp?</b> <br />
			The built-in data sets are updated and expanded continuously. 
			<a href="/data_set_news.html">Recently-added data sets are listed here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p> <b>How do I search the menus?</b> <br />
			In most of the top-level GeoMapApp menus, the first item is "Click for Searchable Tear-Off menus". 
			When clicked, a separate navigation window pops up and at the top of the window is a simple 
			text-based search box. Type in some text (e.g. "Mantle Bouguer Anomaly") and hit return. 
			All menu items containing that term will be highlighted instantly. Note that the search function 
			uses a simple text string pattern-matching scheme so if you are not sure exactly how something 
			may be labelled, keep the search word fairly general (e.g. "bouguer" or "gravity") instead 
			of trying to be too specific.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Does the search function only apply to the displayed map area?</b> <br />
			No, it searches the entire GeoMapApp menu structure for the whole world. 
			So, you may get some matches for data sets that lie outside the displayed map region.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Some climatology menu layers no longer load. Why?</b> <br />
			Some climatology data sets that are loaded dynamically from NASA and NOAA now use 
			"https" as part of the URL path. Older versions of Java do not recognize the SSL 
			certificate used by these sites. If nothing happens when you try loading those data sets, 
			<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml">check the version of Java</a> 
			on your machine. If it is older than version 1.8.0_101 (Java 8, update 101) it will need to be updated. 
			PC/Linux/UNIX users may download the latest version of Java from <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">here</a>. 
			Mac users should <a href="/MacInstall.html">download</a> 
			the latest version of GeoMapApp which includes an appropriate version of Java. 
			Once updated, the climatology layers should load. 
			</p>

			<p> <b>Did the menus structure change?</b> <br />
			In version 3.6.0, released in October 2015, the <i>Basemaps</i> and <i>Datasets</i> 
			menus that had been present in earlier versions of GeoMapApp were merged into one new 
			<i>DataLayers</i> menu. The consolidated <i>DataLayers</i> menu allows the many built-in 
			data sets to be arranged more intuitively and managed more efficiently. The older menu 
			structure has been frozen, is no longer maintained, and is accessible only by using 
			<a href="/ArchiveDownloads.html">older versions</a> of GeoMapApp.
			</p>

			<p> <b>The menus disappeared. How do I get them back?</b> <br />
			In rare instances the menus bar disappears. This behaviour is related to an interrupted 
			internet connection in which only a partial set of menus was downloaded. The partial menus 
			must be removed to make way for a complete set. Try the following steps:<br>
			<ol TYPE="A">
			<li>Close GeoMapApp. Check that you have a reliable internet connection.</li>
			<li>Find and remove the <i>.GMA/menus_cache</i> folder:<br>
			On a <b>PC</b>: Use a Windows navigator window to navigate to your home directory. 
			Look for a folder called "<i>.GMA</i>" (dot GMA). Navigate into the <i>.GMA</i> folder. 
			Delete the "<i>menus_cache</i>" folder.<br>
			On a <b>Mac</b>: The hidden folder called "<i>.GMA</i>" (dot GMA) is not shown in the Finder. 
			Instead, it must be found using a terminal window, as follows.<br>
			In the Finder, go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app. 
			A terminal window should appear. <br>
			To get a list of all files (the ".GMA" folder should be listed), type: <i>ls -a</i> <br>
			To navigate into the hidden folder, type: <i>cd .GMA</i> <br>
			To remove the menu cache, type: <i>rm -r menus_cache</i> <br>
			To be sure it is gone, type: <i>ls -a</i></li>
			<li>Start GeoMapApp. It should take a minute or so 
			for a fresh copy of all of the menu files to be pulled from the server. </li>
			</ol>
			Note that it is also possible to refresh the menus by deleting the higher-level 
			hidden <i>".GMA"</i> folder. However, any saved bookmarks (which are stored in 
			<i>.GMA/places</i>) will be lost. So, if you plan to delete the entire <i>".GMA"</i> folder, 
			make sure you copy the <i>places</i> sub-folder first!
			<p>If the menus still do not show up, please <a href="mailto:info@marine-geo.org">tell us</a>.</p>
			</p>

		<h3><a name="Mapwindow" id="Mapwindow"></a>Map window, base map, and map appearance</h3>

			<p> <b> How do I return to a particular geographic area and zoom level?</b> <br />
			If you zoomed in or out by accident, the Zoom Undo button will undo up to the <i>four</i> most 
			recent zoom actions. The Zoom Undo button is located in the toolbar next to the other zoom buttons. 
			If you wish to store a zoomed area and return to it in a future GeoMapApp session, either
			use the Bookmark functions listed under the Bookmarks menu or use the Session Manager to 
			<i><a href="#ExportFunctions">Save a Session</a></i>.</p>

			<p> <b> Why does the displayed area not match exactly the dimensions of my bookmark?</b> <br />
			GeoMapApp keeps the aspect ratio of the map window so a bookmarked area often has 'extra' 
			space for padding to the window's aspect ratio.</p>

			<p> <b> Can I adjust the map tick marks and border annotations?</b> <br /> 
			The font, font size and location of the axes labels can be changed. Go under File > Preferences.</p>

			<p> <b> How do I change the range of land and ocean colours displayed on the base map?</b> <br />
			That can be done with just two steps: Load the underlying grid and then modify the color palette. 
			This <a class="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B30F9j0exE">tutorial</a> 
			shows how.</p>

			<p> <b> Why do land areas provide better map detail than most parts of the ocean?</b> <br />
			Currently, the <a class="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhz01mJfFQk">GMRT base map</a> 
			contains a range of elevation data sets, including the 10m USGS NED grid for the 48 mainland US states, 
			the 30m SRTM Japanese-US grid for the rest of the world's land elevations, and, for oceanic areas, 
			a large number of data sets from swath mapping cruises and a wide variety of contributed bathymetry grids. 
			The resolution for marine bathymetry data tends to be lower than for land elevation data. About every 
			six months, we release a new version of the base map which usually includes a few dozen 
			additional cleaned multibeam swath cruises. Visit 
			the <a class="external" href="http://www.marine-geo.org/portals/gmrt/">GMRT web page</a> 
			for more details of its component data sets.</p>

			<p> <b> When I close GeoMapApp, I lose everything. Is there a way to "Save a Session"?</b> <br />
			Yes! GeoMapApp includes a <i>Session Manager</i> function that provides the capability 
			to save, store and re-use an instance of a GeoMapApp session. Saving a session captures 
			the loaded data portals and data layers as well as the map location and zoom. It also 
			captures any scaling and coloring applied to tabular data sets. Layer opacity is also preserved.
			When a saved session is imported, GeoMapApp automatically zooms to the pre-set 
			map area and displays the previously-loaded data layers. That could be useful when sharing 
			work with colleagues or students. For example, an educator could use the session functionality 
			to enable all students to start GeoMapApp at exactly the same state. More details are given in the 
			<a class="external" href="/GMA/newHelp/index.html">User Guide</a> 
			as well as on <a href="http://app.geomapapp.org/gma_html/help/Sessions/GMA_Save_Session_info.htm">this</a>
			web page.</p>
			</p>

			<p> <b> Is it possible to add a distance scale and color scale to a map?</b> <br />
			Yes! In the Overlays menu, tick on the items you wish to overlay and they will appear 
			on the map. Note that the distance scale can be dragged with the cursor to a different 
			part of the map and that its scale is latitude-dependent: As the distance scale is 
			dragged north or south, the scale gradations and labels are recalculated based 
			upon the new latitude location of the scale bar. For polar projections the scale 
			depends upon the location of the centre of the scale bar.</p>

			<p> <b> Can free-hand lines or shapes be drawn on the map?</b> <br />
			That is quite a complicated function to add. Currently, we recommend that you use a graphic tool such as Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft PowerPoint or ESRI ArcGIS for that purpose.</p>

		<p style="text-align: right;"><a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<h3><a name="ImportingData" id="ImportingData"></a>Importing Data</h3>

			<p> <b> Can I import my own data?</b> <br />
			Yes! GeoMapApp allows the following data formats to be imported: 
			Grid files, tabular data and spreadsheets, shapefiles, images, WFS and WMS.</p>

			<p> <b> What formats of data files and images can be imported to GeoMapApp?</b> </p>
			<ul>
				<li>ASCII (text) files:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Tab-separated, comma-separated, pipe-separated</li>
				<li>From the clipboard</li>
				<li>From URL</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Excel (tm) spreadsheets: xls and xlsx formats</li>
				<li>Grids:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>netCDF grids in GMT float (nf) or double-precision (nd) format</li>
				<li>ESRI ASCII grid (.asc)</li>
				<li>ESRI Binary grid (.hrd, .flt)</li>
				<li>GRD98 (.G98, Big-Endian only)</li>
				<li>ASCII Polar (.asc)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Images: JPEG, PNG, TIFF</li>
				<li>simple KML / KMZ files</li>
				<li>Shapefile (.shp)</li>
				<li>Data tables (ASCII and Excel (tm) spreadsheets. See above).</li>
			</ul>

			<p> <b> Can a proprietary grid be viewed privately?</b> <br /> 
			Yes! When you import a restricted-access grid, the grid information is stored 
			locally on your machine only. Note that GeoMapApp will generate a set of tiling 
			folders in the same location as the grid on your local machine. If you would like 
			to contribute a grid so that it becomes publically accessible in GeoMapApp 
			please <a href="mailto:info@marine-geo.org">contact us</a>.
			</p>

			<p> <b> Can I import multiple grids at the same time?</b> <br /> 
			Yes. Place all of the grids in one folder then, in the GeoMapApp navigation window, 
			select all of the grid files. The geographical bounds and minimum/maximum Z values are 
			displayed in the lower part of the Confirm Projection and Bounds window. Tick the 
			"Select to Import All Grids at Once" box to automatically process all of the grid files.
			A set of tiling folders is generated in the same location as the grids. Those tiling 
			folders are used to show the different resolutions as 
			you zoom. If you wish to edit particular grids during import, leave the tick box empty 
			and hit the OK button for each grid.  
			In tests, we've successfully imported hundreds of grids at once. If you try to 
			import a very large grid (more than a few hundred MBytes), you may need to boost the 
			amount of memory allocated to GeoMapApp. For that, see the section below called 
			"My grid file cannot be imported. What's wrong?". 
			This <a class="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXJ-Y8Ry0s">tutorial</a> 
			shows how to import several grids at once.
			</p>

			<p> <b> My grid file cannot be imported. What's wrong?</b> <br /> 
			GeoMapApp allows the import of various gridded formats (see list above) and the 
			functionality has been successfully tested on a range of machines. 
			This <a class="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnXJ-Y8Ry0s">tutorial</a> 
			shows how to import a grid. 
			
			If you receive an out-of-memory error or if the import process hangs, it is likely 
			that the grid is very large. There are two approaches we can use.
			First, you could split the large grid into pieces. Then simply use the instructions 
			above for importing multiple grids at once.
			
			The second approach is to increase the memory allocated to running GeoMapApp. 
			The default is between 512-1024 MBytes, but more memory may be required.
			For that, the .jar version of GeoMapApp needs to be run from the command line. 
			Mac and Windows users need to go the 
			<a class="external" href="http://www.marine-geo.org/tools/maps_grids.php">GeoMapApp Linux/Unix download</a>
			page to download the GeoMapApp.jar file. Once the .jar file is available, open 
			a terminal command window, as follows. 
			For Windows 7 users, go to the Start menu, type "cmd" in the search box and select 
			the "cmd" program from the list. 
			For Mac users, go to Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal. 
			In the terminal command window, change directory to the location of the GeoMapApp.jar 
			file (if it was downloaded to your Desktop, simply type "cd Desktop"). Then, type 
			<i>java -jar -Xmx1000m GeoMapApp.jar</i> and press enter. The -Xmx option specifies the 
			amount of memory that can be used by GeoMapApp (in this example, about 1 GByte was allocated). 
			If that still is not enough memory, try allocating more memory. By using this memory allocation 
			approach, grids up to 4 GigaBytes in size have been successfully imported to GeoMapApp.
			
			If you are trying to import one of the recognised formats but still are 
			having problems, please <a href="mailto:info@marine-geo.org">tell us</a> 
			so that we can contact you to investigate.
			</p>

			<p> <b> My imported grid is upside down. Can that be fixed?</b> <br /> 
			Yes. Sometimes a grid may be displayed upside down and further north than it should be. 
			This is related to the way that the data is loaded in the grid. Many grids are 
			loaded from the bottom left (southwest) corner up to the top right (northeast) corner. 
			But, if a grid is loaded from the top to the bottom it will be displayed incorrectly. 
			To fix this, follow these two steps. 
			
			First, assuming you already imported the grid and found it to be upside down and in the 
			wrong place, you will need to delete the local tiles that were created when the grid was 
			imported. That is because the tiles are appended and not overwritten when subsequent grids 
			are imported. To delete the local tiles, go to the folder in which the grid resides. 
			You will see some "z_nnn" folders with names like z_1024 and z_512. Delete all of those 
			"z_nnn" folders. You will also see some shapefile components (.shx, .shp, .dbf, etc). 
			Delete those shapefile components, too. Only the original grid should remain in that folder. 

			Second, now that the incorrect local tiles have been deleted, we may import the grid 
			once more. This time, though, in the <i>Confirm Projection and Bounds</i> pop-up window, 
			click the box labelled "<i>Tick to flip grid along horizontal axis</i>". 
			The imported grid should now be displayed in the correct geographical location 
			in the map window.
			</p>

			<p> <b> When I import my tabular data set, nothing is plotted on the map and there are no records in the 
			table beneath the map. What's wrong?</b> <br />
			In the table below the map window, only data points that fall 
			within the displayed map area will be listed. So, the map window may be zoomed to a different part 
			of the world. Try zooming out (for example, by using Bookmarks > Zoom to Global Scale). Once records 
			successfully reappear in the table beneath the map and symbols are plotted on the map, you can zoom 
			in to that locality. Within the Layer Manager window, the zoom button will zoom automatically to an 
			area containing all of the imported points. Of course, you can always use the zoom button in the tool 
			bar to manually zoom in, too.
			</p>

			<p> <b> My spreadsheet cannot be imported. What should I do?</b> <br />
			First, check that the spreadsheet is in a modern format such as Microsoft .xls 
			or .xlsx format. Second, does the spreadsheet contain any mathematical formulae? 
			GeoMapApp can import spreadsheets containing simple formulae involving +,-,/,* 
			but a complicated formula is likely to cause problems. Third, the latitude and 
			longitude values need to be in separate columns and must be formatetd in decimal 
			degrees. If the spreadsheet still cannot be imported, convert 
			it to a tab-, comma- or pipe-separated ASCII file and use the appropriate ASCII table 
			import option. Convertig a spreadsheet into ASCII format and importing the ASCII file 
			has worked every time in our tests.
			</p>

			<p> <b> When I import a spreadsheet, some values jump into a neighbouring column. Can that be fixed?</b> <br />
			That occurs when a column heading is missing. Open the original spreadsheet or data table and 
			check that every column has a column heading. Then, try importing the corrected file.

		<h3><a name="ExportFunctions" id="ExportFunctions"></a>Export Functions</h3>

			<p> <b>Can I save an image in high-resolution?</b> <br />
			The resolution of a saved image depends upon the size of the GeoMapApp window on your 
			computer screen. That is, it depends upon the number of pixels spanned by the GeoMapApp window.
			Consider an example in which a particular map region is displayed, in the first case, 
			on a small laptop screen and, in the second case, in a large GeoMapApp window on a 
			really big monitor. In this example, the image on the big monitor covers more pixels than the 
			image on the small laptop screen. So, the image exported from big the monitor will have a 
			much higher pixel resolution than the image saved from the laptop. So, if you need a 
			high-resolution image, try to create it in a very large GeoMapApp window on the biggest 
			monitor you can find.  
			Note that the <a class="external" href="http://www.marine-geo.org/tools/maps_grids.php">GMRT MapTool</a> 
			web interface also allows base maps to be generated, and offers for download grids of the 
			base map at three progressively higher resolutions.
			</p>

			<p> <b>The resolution of downloaded base map grids is too low. How do I get higher-resolution versions?</b> <br />
			GeoMapApp stores the base map as a series of nested tiles that cover a wide range of resolutions. 
			As you zoom in, the appropriate set of base map tiles is accessed. If the download resolution is 
			not high enough for your purpose, go under File > Save Map Window as Grid/Image File and click on 
			"Grid: Higher Resolution Options". Selecting that option brings up a 
			<a class="external" href="http://www.marine-geo.org/tools/maps_grids.php">GMRT MapTool</a> 
			web interface that offers a choice of resolution levels for downloading grids of the base map.
			</p>

			<p> <b>I want to export a vector PDF or EPS image file. How do I create one?</b> <br />
			That is on our development list. Currently, images can be exported in JPEG, PNG, 
			KMZ and GeoTIFF formats at the resolution of the screen. Making the GeoMapApp window 
			really big on your screen is one way to produce an image with more pixels.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Is there a way to save and share a GeoMapApp session?</b> <br />
			There is! To promote collaboration and teaching, GeoMapApp offers the capability to save, 
			share, and re-use a pre-loaded state of GeoMapApp. The <i>Session Manager</i> captures the 
			loaded data layers and data portals, along with any symbol coloring and scaling and layer 
			transparency settings. The information is stored as a small file that can be shared with 
			colleagues and students. When that saved session file is imported, GeoMapApp automatically 
			zooms to the same area and displays the same data layers, including any modified colour 
			palettes, contours, symbol scaling and coloring. Sharing a saved session file could be 
			useful in, say, a classroom setting allowing all students to open GeoMapApp at exactly 
			the same state. It could also be useful in preparing figures for publication. For more 
			details, see this 
			<a href="http://app.geomapapp.org/gma_html/help/Sessions/GMA_Save_Session_info.htm">web page</a> 
			and the <a href="/GMA/newHelp/index.html">User Guide</a>.

		<h3><a name="Digitizer" id="Digitizer"></a>Digitizer</h3>

			<p> <b>What does the Digitizer do?</b> <br />
			The Digitizer tool allows any grid to be digitized. By default, the base map (the 
			<a class="external" href="http://www.marine-geo.org/portals/gmrt/">GMRT global elevation model</a>) 
			is digitized. If any other grid is loaded and is the active layer, that grid instead 
			will be digitized. The Layer Manager up-down arrows can be used to select the active 
			grid. </p>

			<p> <b>Can I digitize any grid?</b> <br />
			Yes! The Digitizer function will digitize any active grid. If no grid has been loaded, 
			the <a class="external" href="http://www.marine-geo.org/portals/gmrt/">GMRT</a> 
			base map elevation model grid will be loaded and digitized by default. Otherwise, the 
			currently active grid will be digitized. In the Layer Manager, the active grid is the 
			top-most grid in the list. If more than one grid is loaded, the up-down arrows in the 
			Layer Manager can be used to change the active grid. </p>

			<p> <b>Is there a way to save digitized points?</b> <br />
			Beginning with GeoMapApp version 3.6.6 digitized points can be interactively edited, 
			re-ordered, dragged on the map and deleted, and digitized segments can be appended. 
			The digitized points can be saved as an ASCII table and as a profile. Click on the 
			"Draw Profile" button to activate the profile save options.</p>

		<h3><a name="InternetSpeed" id="InternetSpeed"></a>Internet Speed</h3>

			<p> <b>Sometimes, GeoMapApp is slow. Why?</b> <br />
			The speed of GeoMapApp depends mostly upon the quality of your internet connection. 
			At some meetings and in hotels we have often found internet connectivity to be particularly slow. 
			If you are using a slow wireless connection, try switching to a faster network or to a wired connection. 
			We are testing a "Cloud" version of GeoMapApp.</p>

		<h3><a name="PlotSymbols" id="PlotSymbols"></a>Data Point Symbols</h3>

			<p> <b>Can I choose different symbols for plotting point data?</b> <br />
			Yes! After loading any built-in or imported table or spreadsheet click the Configure 
			button in the right pane. Choose from circles, squares, triangles and stars. 
			The symbol size, outline and color can also be adjusted. That is useful, for 
			example, when viewing multiple tabular data sets that can be distinguished by 
			using a different symbol for each. As before, the symbols can also be colored 
			and scaled.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Is there a way to colour the symbols?</b> <br />
			Yes! Symbols can be coloured in a variety of ways. They can be coloured interactively 
			using the Color button. For imported tables and spreadsheets, a specific colour can 
			be assigned to each symbol by including a column of Red,Green,Blue values in the file. 
			For example, "250,250,0" is yellow. (Note that for some versions of Excel, you may 
			need to format the RGB column as Text so that it is interpreted correctly by GeoMapApp.) 
			To colour all of the symbols with the same colour use the Configure window options. 
			Full details of symbol colouring are to be found in the GeoMapApp 
			<a class="external" href="http://www-dev.geomapapp.org/GMA/newHelp/index.html">User Guide</a>.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Can I colour/scale/configure symbols for multiple data sets?</b> <br />
			Yes! Starting with version 3.6.14, GeoMapApp now allows the display parameters 
			for multiple tabular data sets to be visible at the same time. So, the display 
			parameters for one tabular data set will be preserved and will remain visible 
			when a second tabular data set is loaded. To help distinguish one tabular data set 
			from another, we recommend that you use a different symbol for each data set. 
			To select a symbol click the Configure button in the right pane and choose 
			from circle, square, triangle and star.

		<h3><a name="ExternalDataSets" id="ExternalDataSets"></a>External Data Sets</h3>

			<p> <b>Does GeoMapApp link to the GEOROC database?</b> <br />
			Yes. GEOROC content is included in the EarthChem WFS which is called in GeoMapApp.

		<h3><a name="SaveSession" id="SaveSession"></a>Save Session</h3>

			<p> <b>When GeoMapApp is closed, I lose everything. Is there a way to save my work?</b> <br />
			Yes! GeoMapApp includes a <i>Session Manager</i> that provides the capability 
			to save, store and re-use a GeoMapApp session. Saving a session captures the loaded 
			data portals and data layers along with any symbol coloring and scaling and any 
			layer transparency settings. The information is stored as a small file that can be 
			shared with colleagues and students. When a saved session is imported, GeoMapApp 
			automatically zooms to the pre-set map area and displays the previously-loaded data 
			layers, including any modified colour palettes, contours, symbol scaling and 
			coloring. Sharing a saved session file could be useful in, say, a classroom setting 
			allowing all students to open GeoMapApp at exactly the same state. It could also be 
			useful in preparing figures for publication. More details are given in the 
			<a class="external" href="/GMA/newHelp/index.html">User Guide</a> 
			as well as on <a href="http://app.geomapapp.org/gma_html/help/Sessions/GMA_Save_Session_info.htm">this</a>
			web page.

		<h3><a name="Miscellaneous" id="Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous Functionality</h3>

			<p> <b>When a grid is loaded, why does the color palette change when I zoom or pan?</b> <br />
			The range of colors is automatically normalized to match the z-range of the grid for 
			the region in the map window. That usually ensures a suitable range of colors regardless 
			of the area on view. To fix the colors, you can lock the color palette by clicking the 
			padlock button located next to the "Palettes Menu" button in the Loaded Grids window. 
			For details on changing the colors and using customized color palettes, see 
			this <a class="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B30F9j0exE">tutorial</a>.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Can more than one profile be viewed at a time?</b> <br />
			Yes! Since version 3.6.4, GeoMapApp offers the ability to profile up to four grids at once. 
			The profiles are displayed in a vertical stack and can be saved in various formats.
			</p>

			<p> <b>In the Digitizer function, can the points be saved?</b> <br />
			Yes! Since version 3.6.5 you can save the digitised points and the interpolated points and 
			the digitised profile by clicking the Save button beneath the digitised output.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Does the distance scale overlay change with latitude?</b> <br />
			The distance scale that is selected from the Overlays menu is latitude-dependent so 
			changes when the scale is dragged north (up) or south (down) on the map. The scale 
			gradations and labels change with the latitudinal position of the distance scale.
			For polar projections the scale depends upon the location of the centre of the scale bar.
			</p>

		<h3><a name="WS" id="WS"></a>Web Services (WFS, WMS)</h3>

			<p> <b>Loading a WFS is slow. Can you make it go faster?</b> <br />
			The speed depends a variety of factors including the size of the geographical area being 
			queried, upon the nature of the database query being made at the remote database, and 
			upon the speed of the internet connection. If a WFS is taking too long, zoom to a smaller 
			area and re-try.
			</p>

			<p> <b>The NCEI WFS and WMS no longer connect on my Mac. Do they still work?</b> <br />
			This Mac issue is fixed with the version 3.6.5 release.
