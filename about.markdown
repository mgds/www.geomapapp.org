    <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>© (formerly MapApp) is a 
    freely downloadable <a class="external" href="http://java.sun.com">Java™</a> 
    application, which permits users to browse bathymetry data from the world’s 
    oceans, generate and download custom grids and maps, and explore a variety 
    of other data types. The default basemap is the 
    <a class="external" href="https://www.gmrt.org/">Global Multi-Resolutional Topography</a> 
    Synthesis. The GMRT is dynamically maintained and is composed of grid and image 
    tiles, at a variety of grid node spacings, that are accessed via the Internet 
    by <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>© to dynamically compose 
    seamless grids and images for analysis and viewing.  Bathymetry may be viewed 
    to resolutions as high as 50 meters, where high-resolution data exist.  As new 
    data are added to the compilation, they are immediately visible to users 
    worldwide without the need to download a new version of 
    <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>©.
</p>
<p>
    Bathymetric data can be viewed in a Southern Hemisphere Polar Stereographic or 
    Mercator projection. In the Mercator view, the 
    <a class="external" href="http://topex.ucsd.edu/marine_topo/mar_topo.html">Smith and Sandwell</a>
    (1997) predicted topography compilation is used as a regional background map. 
    For the Polar projection, south of 60°S, we use the 
    <a class="external" href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/aedc/bedmap/">BEDMAP</a> 
    under ice seabed topography compilation from the British Antarctic Survey (Lythe et 
    al., 2000). These regional background maps can be dimmed to display the areas of 
    higher-resolution multibeam bathymetry data coverage. The user can zoom and focus on 
    color shaded relief images, customize the map display and download their custom map 
    images as a PostScript or JPEG file. Grids can be loaded at the viewing resolution, 
    and data can be contoured at a user-specified interval. Grids corresponding to the 
    user-defined map view can be downloaded as ASCII lat-long-depth files or as 
    <a class="external" href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT</a> compatible 
    <a class="external" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> 
    grid files both with (unmasked) and without (masked) the background regional 
    bathymetry compilation. Multibeam ping files can be downloaded for users wishing to 
    create their own grids or to further manipulate the raw data files. Capabilities are 
    also provided for digitizing and downloading points and bathymetric profiles extracted 
    from the gridded data.

<p>
    In addition to bathymetry data, the map browser also provides access to ship-acquired 
    trackline geophysical data with the ability to select a trackline of interest and view 
    corresponding profiles of gravity, magnetics, or topography. 
    <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>© links to the 
    <a class="external" href="http://www.petdb.org">PetDB</a> (Lehnert et al., 2000) 
    petrology database and enables a user to view, select, and download geochemical data 
    from an area of interest along the world’s mid-ocean ridges. Isochrons from Muller et 
    al. (1997) can be superimposed on the bathymetry, showing seafloor age. Earthquake 
    locations from the <a class="external" href="http://www.isc.ac.uk/">International 
    Seismological Center</a> can be plotted. The browser also provides access to the ocean 
    seismicity data set of the 
    <a class="external" href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics.html">NOAA, 
    Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory</a>. This data set includes seismicity 
    detected with moored hydrophone arrays from the northern and equatorial Mid-Atlantic 
    Ridge and East Pacific Rise, and the Navy-operated 
    <a class="external" href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sosus.html">SOSUS</a>
    array in the Northeast Pacific (e.g. Fox et al., 1995; Dziak et al., 1995). Users can 
    create animations of seismic events, which can then be saved as QuickTime movies.
</p>
<p>
    Single-channel seismic profiles from the LDEO archives can be viewed providing 
    information on sediment thickness and stratigraphic relationships between sedimentary 
    layers and igneous basement. These data were scanned from photographic negatives by 
    the <a class="external" href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov">National Geophysical Data 
    Center (NOAA)</a> and have been geo-referenced and incorporated into the map browser. 
    The data were routinely collected during expeditions of Lamont ships in the 1960’s and 
    1970’s and provide a valuable resource, which until the NOAA data rescue effort, were 
    only available in analog form. Capabilities are provided to digitize seismic horizons, 
    and download digitized files as well as seismic images. A viewer with similar 
    capabilities for multi-channel seismic (MCS) data provides access to high-resolution 
    MCS profiles from the many locations worldwide. GeoMapApp provides access to all of 
    these data types, and many more, which allows the user to explore diverse data sets 
    and generate custom maps from a single interface.

<p>
    <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>© is under active development.  New 
    high-resolution bathymetry data are periodically added to the database, new functions 
    are added to existing database interfaces, and new databases are being developed.  
    Data sets that have become accessible through
    <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>© include 
    <a class="external" href="http://www-odp.tamu.edu">ODP (Ocean Drilling Program)</a> 
    data products (including the Borehole Research Group's well-logging database), ocean 
    bottom photographs, oceanic heat flow, and the LDEO Core Repository's sediment core 
    database.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org">GeoMapApp</a>© is downloaded to a user's 
    machine and is run with a live Internet connection that permits periodic connects 
    to our server as new data are requested. The application runs on a wide range of 
    modern operating systems (MacOS 10.4 and above, Windows 98, 2000, XP, Vista, Solaris 2.
    7 and up, and GNU/Linux 2.4 and up). Support for the development of GeoMapApp has been 
    provided by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the National Science Foundation.
