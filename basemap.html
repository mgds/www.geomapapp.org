    <h3>Land/Ice Elevations and Seafloor Depths</h3>

    <h4>Basemap Description (GMRT)</h4>

The Global Multi-Resolution Topography imagery for the Basemap has been
generated at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University
with funding from the US National Science Foundation. For the land
regions, we used the gridded digital elevation datasets provided by the
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, the ASTER Global Digital Elevation
Model, and the National Elevation Dataset of the United States. For the
seabed we incorporated version 6.0 of the SRTM30_PLUS from the Sandwell
Lab, the Arctic bathymetry from version 2.0 of International Bathymetric
Chart of the Oceans and combined these datasets with individual digital
swath echo-soundings from more than 400 major oceanographic expeditions
and more than 100 coastal surveys of the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Agency. The elevations and depths are complied into a nested
set of tiles spanning 11 doublings in magnification to an ultimate
spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel on land (US) and 4 meters per
pixel in offshore coastal regions. For the Arctic and Antarctic ploar projections 
we used the sub-ice land elevations from NSIDC for Greenland and the BEDMAP 
for Antartica.

<h4>Data Sources</h4>
<h5>Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)</h5>

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) obtained elevation data on a
near-global scale to generate tan almost complete high-resolution
digital topographic database of Earth. SRTM consisted of a specially
modified radar system that flew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour
during an 11-day mission in February of 2000. SRTM is an international
project spearheaded by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The SRTM
spatial resolution is 3 arc-sec (~90 meters) globally and 1 arc-sec (~30
meters) for the United States mainland and Hawaii.

<h5>Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)</h5>

ASTER is an imaging instrument flying on Terra, a satellite launched in
December 1999 as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS). ASTER is a
cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry (METI) and Japan's Earth Remote Sensing Data Analysis Center
(ERSDAC). ASTER is being used to obtain detailed maps of land surface
temperature, reflectance and elevation. The three EOS platforms are part
of NASA's Science Mission Directorate whose goal is to observe,
understand, and model the Earth system to discover how it is changing,
to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life on
Earth.  The current ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product was
implemented using new production software at the Land Processes DAAC
starting on May 24, 2006. This is the final validated version of the DEM
product derived using bands 3N and 3B from an ASTER Level-1A data set.
All current ASTER DEM products are generated without using ground
control points (GCPs).

<h5>SRTM30_PLUS</h5>

The 30-arc second (~900 meter) resolution global topography/bathymetry
grid (SRTM30_PLUS) has been developed at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography under the direction of David T. Sandwell from a wide
variety of data sources. Land and ice topography comes from the SRTM30
and ICESat topography, respectively. Ocean bathymetry is based on a new
satellite-gravity model where the gravity-to-topography ratio is
calibrated using 298 million edited soundings. The main contribution of
this study is the compilation and editing of the raw soundings, which
come from NOAA, individual scientists, SIO, NGA, JAMSTEC, IFREMER,
GEBCO, and NAVOCEANO.

<h5>International Bathymetric Chart of the Artic Ocean (IBCAO)</h5>

The goal of this initiative is to develop a digital database that
contains all available bathymetric data north of 64 degrees North, for
use by mapmakers, researchers, and others whose work requires a detailed
and accurate knowledge of the depth and the shape of the Arctic seabed.
Version 2.0 of the IBCAO Grid includes the recent years of multibeam
mapping. The resolution of the Polarstereographic grid has been
increased to 2-km.

<h5>General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)</h5>

The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) consists of an
international group of experts who work on the development of a range of
bathymetric data sets and data products, including gridded bathymetric
data sets, the GEBCO Digital Atlas, the GEBCO world map and the GEBCO
Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names. Through the work of its committees
and working groups, GEBCO produces and makes available a range of
bathymetric data sets and products. The GEBCO_08 Grid at a 30
arc-second (~900 meter) was updated November 2009. The grid has been
generated by combining quality-controlled ship depth soundings with
interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite-derived
gravity data. 
The GEBCO_08 Grid is currently a development product, which will undergo
periodic update. Although every effort has been made to reduce the
number of errors in the data set, we expect that some grid artifacts
will be found.

<h5>Subglacial Topographic Model of the Antarctic (BEDMAP)</h5>

Data describing the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet (collected on surveys
undertaken over the past 50 years) have been brought together into a single
database. These data have allowed the compilation of a suite of seamless digital
topographic models for the Antarctic continent and surrounding ocean. The suite
includes grids representing; ice-sheet thickness over the ice sheet and shelves
water-column thickness beneath the floating ice shelves bed elevation beneath
the grounded ice sheet bathymetry to 60 South including the areas beneath the ice
shelves. These grids are consistent with a recent high-resolution surface
elevation model of Antarctica. While the digital models have a nominal spatial
resolution of 5 km, such high resolution is not strictly justified by the
original data density over all parts of the ice sheet. The suite does however
provide an unparalleled vision of the geosphere beneath the ice sheet and a more
reliable basis for ice sheet modelling. The bed elevation digital elevation model, which includes
the entire geosphere south of 60 South, provides an improved delineation of the
boundary of the boundary between East and West Antarctica and sheds new light on
the morphology of the contiguous East Antarctic landmass, much of which is
buried below an average of 2500 m of ice.

<h5>The ICESAt Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)</h5>

The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSDIDC) archives and distributes 
data products from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System
(GLAS) instrument aboard the NASA Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat)
satellite, launched on 12 January 2003. The main objective of the GLAS
instrument is to measure ice sheet elevations and changes in elevation through
time. Secondary objectives include measurement of cloud and aerosol height
profiles, land elevation and vegetation cover, and sea ice thickness.
