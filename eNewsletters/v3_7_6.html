<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of GeoMapApp, version 3.7.6.</p>
<p>This release includes enhanced functionality and several bug fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Import grids</strong><br>
  When importing grids formatted as netCDF, ESRI ASCII, and GeoTIFF, additional useful information about the import procedure is now provided.
</p>
<p><strong>Earthquake Focal Mechanism Solutions (Centroid Moment Tensor) portal</strong><br>
  The portal now accurately displays the date that its content was last updated.</p>
<p><strong>PetDB portal</strong><br>
  Some buttons in the portal have been rearranged for better visibility.
</p>
<p><strong><i>“New Version Available”</i> functionality</strong><br>
  This notification pop-up window has been greatly simplified for future releases and the “Update” button will automatically download the relevant executable.
</p>
<p><strong>Profile tool and Pop-up windows</strong><br>
  The pop-up windows now initially sit close to the main GeoMapApp window. This is useful when using multiple computer monitors. A bug that affected the position of the Profile window has also been fixed. And, the “Processing…” window now no longer blocks the map tool bar.
</p>
<p><strong>Menu font</strong><br>
  The menu font style and size are now fully customizable via the File > Preferences menu which allows for clearer legibility when using high-resolution monitors.
</p>
