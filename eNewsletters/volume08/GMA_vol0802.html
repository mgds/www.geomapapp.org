    Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.4.0. Highlights of the release include several enhancements and bug fixes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, Mac users running 10.8.x or 10.9.x and higher that have trouble downloading the new application should see our <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org/FAQ.html"target="_blank">FAQ page</a> for instructions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GMRT base map <b>Tiles</b> now load sequentially allowing the map to be refreshed more quickly when zooming and panning. At the bottom of the window frame, <b>Elevation Data Sources</b> can be listed, with updated country flags showing the nations that have contributed data for the GMRT elevation model.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A <b>Save Sessions</b>/<b>Import Sessions</b> function is now available. It provides limited ability to save, store and re-use an instance of a GeoMapApp session. Saving a session under <i>File > Session Manager</i> captures the loaded data portals and data layers as well as the map location and zoom. When a saved session is imported, the application automatically zooms to the pre-set map area and displays the previously-loaded data layers and portals. The choices to zoom and load all layers are also added to the My Layer Sessions menu. Save Sessions/Import Sessions functionality could be useful for teaching, allowing an educator, for example, to have all students start GeoMapApp at the same view with the same data sets loaded.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When point data is loaded, improvements to the <b>load/import data sets</b> and <b>decimation of points</b> allow better control of the number of points plotted on the map. If a data set contains more than 20,000 records, a choice is given to plot all of the points (potentially impacting graphics card performance) or to plot a geographically-decimated subset of the points (may not display all valid points). When <b>importing ASCII data from a URL</b>, the import function prompts the user if the data set has more than 100,000 points. The ability to <b>sort</b> a data column has been improved.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Progress bars and status messages for the <b>Multibeam Swath Bathymetry portal</b> have been updated. Once loaded, the Multibeam Swath Bathymetry portal is cached automatically, making subsequent loading times very fast. The <b>Ocean Drilling</b> portal is now correctly released when closed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When <b>importing multiple grids</b>, the geographical bounds and Z-range of the selected grids are now correctly identified. An optional one-click import function accepts and applies those bounds to all of the chosen grids.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The availability of <b>Tear-Off Menus</b> is highlighted at the top of each menu - when clicked, a separate navigation window helps users quickly navigate the menus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other improvements and bug fixes requested by the GeoMapApp user community have also been included such as the location of saved files now defaulting to a user's home directory, a clearer distance scale bar, and fixes to correctly display the red-green-blue symbol colors of an imported spreadsheet or data table. Tool tip information was also updated. Visit the GeoMapApp <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org/WhatsNew.html" target="_blank">development history</a> page for more details and a <b>complete list of changes</b>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As always, you may email us with any problems, comments, and/or suggestions at <b>info@geomapapp.org</b></font></p>
