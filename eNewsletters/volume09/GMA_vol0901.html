    Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.5.0.<br><br>
Highlights of this release include a major upgrade in GeoMapApp to <b>Java 7</b>. GeoMapApp will no longer work with older versions of Java. Please ensure that you have Java 7 or higher installed on your machine.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Mac users, GeoMapApp now supports the new <b>Gatekeeper</b> security in Mac OS X Lion v10.7.5 and higher. GeoMapApp also has a new installer and is now signed with a <b>trusted Apple Developer ID</b> which should address Mac downloading issues. However, due to changes in Mac OS X bundling, users with Mac OS X Snow Leopard v10.6 and below will need to continue using GeoMapApp version 3.4.1, available <a href="/ArchiveDownloads.html"target="_blank">here</a>. Our <a href="/FAQ.html"target="_blank">FAQ page</a> provides more information.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GMRT base map images now <b>load faster</b> in all projections allowing the map to be refreshed more quickly when zooming and panning. Additionally, the underlying GMRT grids are provided at greater precision.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An <b>Undo Last Zoom</b> action is now available. The new feature is found in the toolbar next to the other zoom icons, and will undo the most recent zoom action once.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new Web Feature Service for the IEDA <b>EarthChem</b> database provides access to geochemical data and samples information.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other improvements and bug fixes requested by the GeoMapApp user community have also been included. Examples are found in the profile tool that now always has two or more annotation labels in the y-axis; and, when importing tabular data files, GeoMapApp now treats lines that begin with a '#' symbol as a comment. Visit the GeoMapApp <a href="/WhatsNew.html" target="_blank">development history</a> page for more details and a complete list of changes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As always, please email us with any problems, comments, or suggestions at <b>info@geomapapp.org</b> or make a post to the <a href="http://geomapapp.freeforums.org/" target="_blank">GeoMapApp User Forum</a>.</font></p>
