    Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.0.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new <b>DataLayers</b> menu consolidates the wide range of built-in global, regional, and local geoscience data sets that were originally listed under the Basemaps and Datasets menus in earlier versions of GeoMapApp. The consolidation allows the DataLayers menu to be structured more intuitively and managed more efficiently. The old-style menus are now frozen and no longer maintained but remain available for use with <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org/ArchiveDownloads.html" target="_blank">older versions</a> of  GeoMapApp.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Zoom Undo</b> function has been expanded to capture the four most recent zoom actions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Session Manager (Save Session)</b> has been enhanced and offers a basic ability to store, share, and re-use an instance of a GeoMapApp session. Saving a session (File > Session Manager) captures limited features that include the loaded built-in data layers, layer transparency, map location, and zoom level. It also captures any loaded data portal. The captured information is stored as a small XML file that can be shared with colleagues and students. When a saved session file is imported, GeoMapApp automatically zooms to the  geographical area and displays the data layers. A saved session could be shared with a class to allow every student to open GeoMapApp at exactly the same starting point with the same data layers loaded and the same area displayed. When using GeoMapApp to generate a figure for publication, storing the session could be useful for later re-use.</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This release also includes other updates and bug fixes such as a new status bar when loading the <b>Analog Seismic Reflection Profiles</b> portal.</font></p>
