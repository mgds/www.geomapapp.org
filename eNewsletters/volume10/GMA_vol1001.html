    Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.2.<br><br>

Highlights of the release include several enhancements in response to community requests and a number
of bug fixes.</p>

<p>The handling of <strong>tabular data sets</strong> has been enhanced. User <em>imported</em> tabular data records can now be
<strong>edited</strong>, with the changes displayed in real-time. Color and scale ranges can be inverted and a color
legend and scale legend are now available. When tabular records are plotted as tracks instead of
stations, the Configure pen attributes (thickness, type, color) allow users to specify the track line
parameters.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Underway Bathymetry, Gravity and Magnetics Anomalies portal</strong>, a new <em>'save profile'</em> button
allows the profile image to be saved. The displayed profile can also be auto-scaled. An option has been
added allowing users to import their own <strong>MGD77T</strong> tab-separated format data files. Imported MGD77 and
MGD77T files remain cached for later use.</p>

<p>An expanded range of <strong>color palettes</strong> has been added to GeoMapApp. When gridded or tabular data is
displayed, users can now choose from more than 60 different palettes including all the ones available in
the <em>GMT</em> software. The palette export capability has been upgraded.</p>

<p>The <strong>Save Session</strong> function (<em>File &gt; Session Manager</em>) has been significantly enhanced. It provides the
ability to save, store and re-use an instance of a GeoMapApp session. Saving a session captures all
loaded data portals and data layers, the map location and, new for this release, Save Session now
captures any coloring and scaling of points as well as the grid palette. When a saved session is imported,
GeoMapApp automatically zooms to the pre-set map area, displays the previously-loaded data layers and
portals, and colors/scales any points and grids. Saved sessions are useful for teaching and for
collaboration - simply share the session file with colleagues and students to have GeoMapApp start up in
the same state. Save Session functionality has also been added to the north and south polar projections.</p>

<p>The default <strong>south polar base map</strong> which is from the GMRT synthesis has been updated to include the
v1.0 International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) 500m-resolution grid as the latest
regional compilation in areas lacking high-resolution multibeam sonar data.</p>

<p>A limited functionality <em>Beta</em> <strong>Survey Planner Waypoints Portal</strong> provides track line distances and sailing
times. Multiple parallel survey tracks can be generated automatically. The portal remains under
development with planned enhancements including the ability to pick multiple station waypoints from the
map and to determine track line spacing and waypoints based upon depth. We welcome your feedback
on future capabilities.</p>

<p>The availability of <strong>Tear-Off Menus</strong> is highlighted at the top of each menu - when clicked, a separate
navigation window helps users quickly navigate the menus.</p>

<p>Other improvements and bug fixes requested by the GeoMapApp user community have also been
included such as an upgrade to the <strong>profiling tool</strong> pointer to provide better accuracy; a corrected display
of the Z value in the top bar when multiple grids are loaded; better import ability for UTM grids; and
enhanced capability to access the components of a remote <strong>WMS</strong> (Web Mapping Service).</p>
