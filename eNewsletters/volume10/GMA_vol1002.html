    Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.3.</p>

<p>In North and South Polar projections, a bug related to <strong>loading global and contributed grids</strong> has been fixed.</p>

<p>Two bugs relating to setting the <strong>color or scale size</strong> of data points in tables that contain empty or partially filled columns have also been addressed.</p>

<p>This new release should also resolve an issue that some Mac users encountered when trying to save seismic profiles in the <strong>Digital Seismic Reflection Profiles</strong> portal.</p>

<p>The <strong>Save Session</strong> functionality can now be used to correctly reload color palettes for multiple saved grids. </p>

<p>In addition, new functionality in this new release allows users to define the Z value units and the data type when <strong>importing a grid</strong>. The user-specified values will be displayed with the Z value in the top bar and with a profile y-axis annotation.</p>

<p>Visit the GeoMapApp <a href="http://www.geomapapp.org/WhatsNew.html" target="_blank">development history</a> 
page for more details and a <strong>complete list of changes</strong>. As
always, you may email us with any problems, comments, or suggestions at <strong>info@geomapapp.org</strong></p>
