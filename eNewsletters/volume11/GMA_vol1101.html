<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.4.</p>

<p>Highlights of the release include function enhancements and a number of bug fixes.</p>

<p>The <strong>Profile Tool</strong> has been significantly enhanced. Now, up to four different grids can be profiled at once. This multiple profiling function will vertically stack the graphs in the same order that the grids are layered in the map window. Individual graphs can be toggled off/on using the check boxes in the Layer Manager window. Also, profile tool activation has been consolidated into the single Profile Tool button in the toolbar.</p>

<p>The global and regional <strong>Grid Dialog</strong> windows have been consolidated into a single <strong>Loaded Grids</strong> window. In the toolbar, the <strong>grid activation button</strong> (the waffle iron symbol second from right) now operates as a shortcut for toggling the GMRT base map grid on and off. The <strong>Grid Import</strong> function has been improved to automatically detect grids in UTM projection. Additionally, a log file can now be generated <em>(File > Preferences > Grid Imports)</em> to keep track when importing groups of grid files, and updated verbosity is displayed.</p>

<p>The <strong>Save Session</strong> function <em>(File > Session Manager)</em> has been improved by adding support to now save Overlays layers such as state and country boundaries, lakes and rivers. Saving a session captures all loaded data layers and portals and any coloring and scaling. When a saved session is imported, GeoMapApp automatically zooms to the pre-set map area, displays the previously-loaded data layers and portals, and colors and scales any points and grids. Saved sessions are useful for teaching and for collaboration &ndash; simply share the session file with colleagues and students to have GeoMapApp start up in exactly the same state.</p>

<p>The availability of <strong>Tear-Off Menus</strong> is highlighted at the top of each menu &ndash; when clicked, a separate navigation window helps users quickly navigate the menus.</p>

<p>The <strong>menus cache</strong> is now cleared when a new version of GeoMapApp is installed. This ensures that users starting the new version have access to the latest data set menu content.</p>

<p>Other improvements and bug fixes requested by the GeoMapApp user community have also been implemented. These include layers from the <strong>Overlays</strong> menus that are now correctly toggled on and off; a fix for some <strong>remotely-served data</strong> services such as the USGS catalogue of past day/week/month earthquakes; grid units are now correctly displayed in the top bar and in the profile tool; and fixes to the <strong>Digital Seismic Reflection Profiles Portal</strong> for the display of USGS multi- and single-channel seismic data. Also, normalization of the color range of than 60 <strong>color palettes</strong> is now done automatically. And, keyboard shortcuts for Macs have been fixed.</p>
