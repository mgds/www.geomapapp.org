<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.8.</p>

<p>Highlights of the release include:</p> 

<p>The new <strong>GPS Velocity Vector</strong> portal allows geodetic velocity solutions to be drawn on the map. Choose from the built-in UNAVCO geodetic data sets or import your own velocity solutions.</p> 

<p>The <strong>Waypoints and Survey Planner</strong> portal provides a range of options for generating, importing, and editing waypoints and survey lines. When a grid is loaded, imported waypoints now sample that grid at the specified coordinates.</p>

<p>The <strong>Digitizer</strong> function offers a choice between great circle and straight line paths, and points can be dragged on the map.</p>

<p>The <strong>contouring</strong> function allow contours to be plotted on a transparent grid and to be drawn in bold at user-specified intervals.</p>

<p>Other improvements and bug fixes requested by the GeoMapApp user community have also been implemented. The USGS <strong>earthquake location catalogs</strong> for the past hour, day, week, month time periods now load correctly. Other included fixes are to the import and saving of tabular data sets; to the zoom function for map areas straddling the Greenwich meridian; to the robustness of the Rivers overlay; and, improved handling of user-imported netCDF grids, and the ability to plot imported tabular data as coloured track segments.</p>

<p>As always, you may email us with any problems, comments, or suggestions at <strong>info@geomapapp.org</strong></p>
