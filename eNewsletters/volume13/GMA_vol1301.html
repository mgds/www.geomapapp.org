<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.10.</p>

<p>This release includes several bug fixes and data portal content updates:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The PetDB portal is updated to include analytical and compiled geochemical data derived from more than 70,000 mainly seafloor samples currently in the PetDB database. The geochemical data can be filtered, displayed, and saved in a variety of ways.</li>
    <li>The USGS Earthquake Locations data tables and the Earthquake Focal Mechanism Solutions (CMT) portal tables have been updated.</li>
    <li>In the Digital and Analog Seismic Reflection Profiles portals, the ability to digitize seismic horizons has been fixed.</li>
    <li>Grid import capabilities have been boosted by fixing bugs that affected grids straddling the Greenwich meridian and some grids in UTM and netCDF formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other bug fixes necessary to maintain GeoMapApp have also been implemented.</p>

<p>The GeoMapApp <a href="http://app.geomapapp.org/gma_html/help/User_Guide/User_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">User Guide</a> has been updated to match the new release.</p>

<p>As always, you may email us with any problems, comments, or suggestions at <strong>info@geomapapp.org</strong></p>
