<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.11.</p>

<p>This release includes several bug fixes and a data portal content update.</p>
<p>
Portal Update: The geochemistry PetDB portal is updated to February 2021 to include analytical and compiled geochemical data derived from more than 76,500 mainly seafloor samples currently in the PetDB database. The geochemical data can be filtered, displayed, and saved in a variety of ways. 
</p>
<p>
    Bug Fixes: The following issues were amongst those that have been fixed in this new version:
    <ul>
        <li>PetDB portal external URLs.</li>
        <li>Ocean Drilling portal external URLs.</li>
        <li>Grid import: ESRI ASCII and Polar ASCII grids now import properly. Number of grid nodes now displays correctly. Upside-down grids can now be flipped the right way up.</li>
        <li>Save Session layer ordering and contour bolding.</li>
        <li>Multibeam swath bathymetry portal caching and load times.</li>
        <li>Issues with the Distance Scale and Country Boundaries overlays.</li>
        <li>Analog Seismic Profile portal: Problems with imported digitized files.</li>
        <li>Island land elevations at high zoom factors.</li>
