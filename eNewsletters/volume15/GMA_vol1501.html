<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce a new release, version 3.6.15.</p>

<p>
    This release completes the migration of GeoMapApp to the https architecture to improve both performance and security. 
    Please update your version of GeoMapApp to this new version. Due to the switch, older versions of GeoMapApp will stop 
    working after December 31st 2022. We encourage you to upgrade now.
</p>
<p>
    The new release also includes updates to the GMRT base map Elevation Data Sources information.
