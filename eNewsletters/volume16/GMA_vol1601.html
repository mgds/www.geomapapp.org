<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of GeoMapApp, version 3.7.0.</p>

<p>This release includes several bug fixes, updates to two data portals, and improvements to the Digitizer 
function and to the tabular data capabilities.</p>

<p>The PetDB portal has been improved to better handle the quarterly PetDB updates. However, to continue 
using the PetDB portal, users will need to upgrade to this new version of GeoMapApp.</p>

<p>The Waypoints and Survey Planner Portal and the toolbar Digitizer function have both been enhanced to 
allow intermediate points to be added to an already-digitized segment.</p>

<p>Some bugs in the tabular data capability have been fixed: By default, imported tabular data points are 
plotted as circles ("Stations") on the map. The Configure button allows the user to switch to "Track" mode 
which joins the points with a continuous line. These lines are now displayed properly. Also, imported text 
files containing "&gt;" segment separators are now correctly handled.</p>

<p>This release also includes bug fixes necessary to maintain GeoMapApp.</p>

<p>You may email us with any problems, comments, or suggestions at <a href="mailto:info@marine-geo.org"><strong>info@marine-geo.org</strong></a>.</p>
