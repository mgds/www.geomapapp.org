<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of GeoMapApp, version 3.7.2.</p>
<p>This release includes several bug fixes and an update to the Digital Seismic Reflection Profiles portal.</p>
<p>When the Digital Seismic Reflection Profiles portal is loaded, all seismic lines for all cruises are now 
  displayed on the map so that the full extent of the available seismic data is immediately evident.</p>
<p>In addition to these updates, we would like to inform users that since October 2023 GeoMapApp has 
  been running from the Cloud. This has yielded improved stability and faster performance.</p>
<p>More details about the release may be found <a href="../../WhatsNew.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, you may e-mail us with any problems, comments, or suggestions at <a href="mailto:info@marine-geo.org">info@marine-geo.org</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>The GeoMapApp Team<br>GeoMapApp: <a href="https://www.geomapapp.org">www.geomapapp.org</a></p>
