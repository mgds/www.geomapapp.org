<p><br>Dear GeoMapApp community,<br></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of GeoMapApp, version 3.7.5.</p>
<p>This release includes new functionality and several bug fixes.</p>
<p><b>Import grids</b></p>
<p>GeoMapApp is now able to import GeoTIFF-formatted grids. The grids can be in either geographic or UTM projection. This addition of GeoTIFF grid import capability complements the existing functionality for importing netCDF and ESRI ASCII/Binary grids.</p>
<p><b>Multibeam Swath Bathymetry portal</b></p>
<p>This portal allows users to quickly identify and download multibeam swath data files. The portal now shows when the swath file content was last updated.</p>
<p><b>PetDB portal</b></p>
<p>This analytical geochemistry portal now shows when the PetDB data content was last updated.</p>
<p><b>Multibeam Swath Bathymetry portal</b></p>
<p>A bug fix has been made to properly release the underlying <a href="https://www.gmrt.org/" target="_blank">GMRT</a> base map grid after extracting elevations at the specified locations.</p>
<p>More details about the release may be found <a href="../../WhatsNew.html">here</a>. This release also coincides with the release of the updated <a href="https://www.gmrt.org/" target="_blank">GMRT</a> base map, version 4.3.1.</p>
